Everyone is chasing trillions of parameters. The biggest labs are building data centers that consume more power than
small cities. But I think the real breakthrough for businesses isn't in making models bigger. It is in making them small
enough to run everywhere.

### Latency is the killer

If you are building a voice agent or a real-time copilot, waiting 2 seconds for a cloud API is too long. The magic
breaks. Small Language Models (SLMs) that run locally on a device can respond in milliseconds. That feels like a
conversation, not a transaction.

### Data stays home

Privacy is the other massive lever. Financial data, health records, and personal chats should not leave the device if
they don't have to. Running a 3B parameter model on a laptop is now possible and surprisingly capable for specific tasks
like summarization or classification.

The future isn't one giant brain in the cloud. It is billions of tiny, specialized brains running on the edge.
