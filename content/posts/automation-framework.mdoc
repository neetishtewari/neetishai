I see this all the time. A team is drowning in manual work, so they hire an engineer to "automate it." The engineer
scripts the exact messy process the team was doing manually. Now they have a messy process that just happens faster.

**Never automate a bad process.**

Here is the simple framework I use when helping teams:

### 1. Map the Flow

Write down every single step. Who emails whom? Where does the data go? You will be surprised how many loops and dead
ends exist once you see them on paper.

### 2. Simplify (The Delete Button)

Before writing a line of code, ask: "Do we need to do this step at all?" Most approvals, CCs, and double-checks are
legacy habits, not requirements. Cut them.

### 3. Automate the Remainder

Now that the process is clean, let the robots handle it. Use LLMs for decision points and scripts for moving data. But
only automate what creates value.
